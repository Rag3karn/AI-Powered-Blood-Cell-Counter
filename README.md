In this repo, I've trained an object detection model on a custom dataset to find the number of RBC, WBC, PLATELETS Count from the microscopic blood-smeared images. Original Dataset available at [here](https://github.com/Shenggan/BCCD_Dataset).

Preprocessed dataset for Yolo-v5 available at [here](https://github.com/Rag3karn/AI-Powered-Blood-Cell_Counter/tree/master/dataset-preprocessed/)

Built using Yolo-v5 model open-sourced by ultralytics, more at [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)

Simply start the training and validation here [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bala-codes/Yolo-v5_Object_Detection_Blood_Cell_Count_and_Detection/blob/master/codes/1.%20Yolo-V5%20BCC%20Training%20%26%20Testing.ipynb) and to begin inference  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bala-codes/Yolo-v5_Object_Detection_Blood_Cell_Count/blob/master/codes/2.%20Yolo-v5%20BCC%20Inference.ipynb)

The Inference notebook is similar to move the model in production environment. You need to these files in your system path for proper imports, you can get them from here       [Yolo-v5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
